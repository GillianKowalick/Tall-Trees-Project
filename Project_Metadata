Access:

1. Download zip file from link http://due.esrin.esa.int/files/Globcover_V2.2_Global.zip (direct download, 277MB) 
2. Extract zip file, which should produce a folder `Globcover_V2.2_Global`. Rename the folder to `Globcover` and copy into `data`. 

Processing: We also created a downscaled version of the data, using script `Globcover/downscaling.R`, to create `Globcover/downscaled/globcover_downscaled.grd` and `Globcover/downscaled/globcover_downscaled.gri`

### Fire Size

Folder: firedata

Description: Spatial data of fire sizes (km^2) from 2003-2016 determined based on the fraction of burnt area in each cell at 500m resolution. The MODIS colleciton 6 MCD64A1 burned product area and Global Fire Atlas Algorithm were used to collect the data. The data are yearly GeoTiffs with bands providing monthly fire size data.

Ridge, Tennessee, USA. https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1642


Access:

1. Downloaded from https://webmap.ornl.gov/ogc/dataset.jsp?ds_id=1642 . Monthly areas burned measurements were selected in WGS 84 projection in GeoTiff format. Data was downloaded for each month for each year of avaliable data.

Processing:
A function was created to load the data into R including setting the extent, stacking the monthly bands for each year together and transforming data into a dataframe. The data for each year were combined to create total burnt area and mean burnt area variables. The data was rescaled so the coordinates matched the other datasets.
